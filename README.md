**DESCRIPTION OF TASK 


A dashboard is a visual interface that consolidates key metrics and insights from data sets into a single screen. We built with tools like Tableau or Power BI, which will provide us with interactive visualizations and easy data connectivity through reports and graphs.

Building in Tableau:
1.Connect – Open Tableau, select the data source, and load the cleaned tables.
2.Create a worksheet for each visual (bar chart, line chart, map, etc.). Use the “Show Me” panel to pick the appropriate chart type.
3. Add interactivity – Use filters, parameters, and actions to let users slice data by region, date range, product line, etc.
4. Assemble the dashboard – Drag worksheets onto a new dashboard sheet. Adjust sizes, set tiled or floating layouts, and add title, legend, and navigation buttons.
5. Publish – Save to Tableau Server or Tableau Public for web sharing; set permissions as needed.

Building in Power BI:
1. Import data – Use Power BI Desktop’s “Get Data” to pull from the same sources. Apply Power Query transformations to clean and shape the data.
2. Design visuals – Choose from the visual pane (card, column chart, line chart, map, etc.). Drag fields onto the canvas and fine‑tune using the formatting options.
3. Implement slicers and drill‑through – Add slicers for date, region, etc.; configure drill‑through pages for deeper analysis.
4. Arrange the report – Use the “Page” view to create a dedicated dashboard page. Align visuals, set a consistent color palette, and add a header with the report title.
5. Publish – Click “Publish” to push the report to Power BI Service. From there, you can share links, embed in SharePoint/Teams, or schedule data refreshes.
PREREQUISITE

**DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE DASHBOARD:


This Power BI dashboard is based on a pizza sales report and includes various fields such as pizza category, pizza name, day of the week, and pizza size. The dashboard offers valuable insights like the most popular pizza, the pizza generating the lowest revenue, the pizza generating the highest revenue, total orders, total revenue, average order value, and the least ordered pizza.
These insights are presented through data visualizations like bar graphs and line graphs, showing metrics such as:
- Total orders by quarter
- Total revenue by month
- Quantity per order by month
- Average order value by month
- Total revenue by quarter
- Total orders by month

The dashboard also features a navigation panel with pages for:
- Recommended analysis, objective, and summary
- Top and bottom three pizza analysis
- Orders by time
- Orders by time analysis
- Revenue by time series analysis
- Revenues and orders
- Pizza with the highest and lowest revenue
- Orders and revenue per time series
- Peak days and hours
- Seasonality
- Pizza ordered by size
  

**INSIGHTS DERIVED FROM DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT


1. Immediate pattern spotting– By dragging fields onto a canvas you can see trends, outliers, and clusters the moment the chart updates. A line that suddenly spikes tells you something happened (e.g., a promotion) without writing a single line of code.

2. Drill‑down capability – Filters, parameters, and action links let users slice the data by region, product line, date range, etc. This turns a static report into an exploratory tool where each click reveals a deeper layer of insight.

3. Comparative analysis – Side‑by‑side bar charts, heat maps, or scatter plots make it easy to compare performance across categories or time periods. You can quickly answer “How did Region A perform versus Region B this quarter?”

4. Real‑time monitoring – Connecting to live databases or streaming sources (e.g., SQL, Azure, Snowflake) means the dashboard reflects the latest data. A KPI card that updates every few seconds keeps everyone aligned on current status.

5. Storytelling with data – Tableau’s “Story” feature, Power BI’s “Bookmarks”, or Dash’s custom layouts let you assemble a narrative flow. You can guide stakeholders through the problem, evidence, and recommendation in a single interactive presentation.

6. Accessibility & sharing – Publish to Tableau Server, Power BI Service, or host a Dash app on Heroku/Azure. Users can access the dashboard from a browser, embed it in internal portals, or schedule email snapshots.

7. Performance optimization – All three platforms cache aggregated results and let you pre‑compute extracts. This means even large datasets (millions of rows) remain responsive because the visual engine works on summarized data rather than raw rows.

8. Extensibility – Need a custom calculation or a specific statistical test? Tableau and Power BI support calculated fields and DAX/PQL. Dash gives you full Python flexibility, so you can plug in scikit‑learn, plotly‑based animations, or any custom web component.
